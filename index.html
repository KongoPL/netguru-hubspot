					Flutter is Google's mobile app software development kit (SDK) made to build cross-platform applications. It's a complete environment with a framework, widgets, and tools, which gives you the opportunity to develop mobile apps efficiently. Thanks to rich widgets, Flutter apps look and feel great. You can create your own custom app design or use ready UI elements following specific platforms’ guidelines.

							The simplicity of Python means that not only is it easy to maintain, but it can also handle quick growth. What’s more, if you use the <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django framework</a> – the most popular framework for Python – you will also put yourself in good stead to scale. This is because the components that make up Django are decoupled (i.e. independent from one another), which means that they can be chopped, changed, removed, and replaced as and <b>when your project requires larger or more specific solutions.</b>
